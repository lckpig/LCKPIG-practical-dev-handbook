# TypeScript

## Introduction

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language based on JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft and is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

## Main Features

- **Static Typing**: Allows defining types for variables, functions, and objects.
- **Interfaces**: Facilitates the definition of contracts for objects.
- **Classes and Inheritance**: Full support for object-oriented programming.
- **Generics**: Allows creating reusable components.
- **Decorators**: Enables adding metadata and modifying class and method behavior.
