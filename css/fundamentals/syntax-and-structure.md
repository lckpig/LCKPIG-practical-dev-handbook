# CSS Syntax and Structure

CSS syntax consists of a set of rules that define how styles are applied to HTML elements. Each CSS rule is composed of a selector and a declaration block.

## Basic Structure

```css
selector {
  property1: value1;
  property2: value2;
  /* Comments in CSS */
}
```

## Ways to Include CSS

There are three main ways to include CSS in an HTML document:

1. **Inline CSS**: Directly in the `style` attribute of an HTML element.
2. **Internal CSS**: Inside `<style>` tags in the `<head>` of the document.
3. **External CSS**: In separate `.css` files linked using the `<link>` tag.

## Structural Best Practices

- Organize CSS by components or sections
- Maintain consistency in formatting (indentation, spacing)
- Use comments to document important sections
- Follow a coherent naming convention

Understanding the basic syntax of CSS is fundamental before moving on to more complex concepts such as advanced selectors, cascade, and inheritance.
