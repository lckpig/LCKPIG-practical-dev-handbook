# Modern Layouts in CSS

Modern layout systems in CSS have revolutionized the way we create web interfaces, providing powerful and flexible tools to structure content on the page.

## Content

- [Flexbox](flexbox.md)
- [CSS Grid](css-grid.md)
- [Multi-columns](multi-columns.md)

## Evolution of Layouts in CSS

The web has evolved from primitive HTML table-based layouts to sophisticated and powerful systems:

1. **HTML Tables**: The original (and now discouraged) way to create layouts
2. **Floats and positioning**: Traditional techniques with limitations
3. **Flexbox**: One-dimensional system for rows or columns
4. **Grid**: Two-dimensional system for rows and columns simultaneously
5. **Multi-columns**: Newspaper-like layout for extensive content

## Advantages of Modern Layouts

- More flexible and adaptable designs
- Less code and fewer hacks to achieve complex results
- Better performance and maintainability
- More precise alignment and distribution
- Improved support for responsive design

Learning these modern layout systems is essential for any current frontend developer.
