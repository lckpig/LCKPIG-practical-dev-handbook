# Box Model and Layout in CSS

The box model is one of the fundamental concepts in CSS that defines how HTML elements are visually represented. Each element on the web page is treated as a rectangular box that has content, padding, border, and margin.

## Content

- [Box Model](box-model.md)
- [Positioning](positioning.md)
- [Display and Visibility](display-and-visibility.md)

## Importance of the Box Model

Understanding how the box model works is essential for:

- Controlling the size and space occupied by elements
- Creating precise and predictable layouts
- Avoiding common design problems
- Implementing advanced positioning techniques

Mastering the box model and positioning techniques will allow you to create complex and responsive web designs with greater ease and precision.
