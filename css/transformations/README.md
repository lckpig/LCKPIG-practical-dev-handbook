## The Power of CSS Transformations

Modern CSS provides powerful capabilities for modifying the appearance and behavior of elements:

- **Transform properties**: Rotate, scale, skew, and move elements in 2D or 3D space
- **Transitions**: Create smooth animations between state changes
- **Keyframe animations**: Define complex multi-step animations
- **Filters**: Apply visual effects like blur, brightness adjustment, and shadows
- **Blend modes**: Control how elements blend with their background

These features enable rich, interactive web experiences while maintaining good performance and accessibility. When used effectively, they can greatly enhance user experience without sacrificing page load times or responsiveness.
